# Quant Trading & Systematic Strategies

This repository presents a structured exploration of quantitative finance and systematic trading strategies, with a strong emphasis on statistical foundations, market risk analysis, and robust backtesting practices.

The project is organized around reusable quantitative tools, clean data pipelines, and well-documented research notebooks. It covers core topics such as return modeling, portfolio risk, drawdowns, Monte Carlo simulations, and the implementation and evaluation of momentum and mean-reversion strategies.

The objective of this work is not to optimize performance at all costs, but to demonstrate a rigorous and realistic approach to quantitative research, highlighting assumptions, limitations, and sources of bias.

This repository is intended as a professional portfolio for quantitative research, trading analyst, or junior quant roles.
